A project to share text between Windows and Android Devices.

## Getting Started

This project uses Firebase to share real-time data.
I hope to use WSL on Windows to run the Android App on Windows.
Hoping to add Linux, MacOS and iOS support sometime in the future.

New changes will go into the beta branch first.
