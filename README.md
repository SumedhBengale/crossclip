A project to share text between Windows and Android Devices.

## Getting Started

This project uses Firebase and TCP Sockets to share real-time Text(over the Internet) and files(over the local network).
This app has 2 versions as of yet, a Windows and an Android version.
Hoping to add Linux, MacOS and iOS support sometime in the future.

New changes will go into the beta branch first and then into the main branch.
